## Pokedex
This project is to use a pretrained MobileNetV2 model and fine tune it to identify image of a pokemon from one of 150 generation one pokemons. Also you can provide the name of the pokemon and it downloads 4 images of that pokemon from the web and predicts their name. The model is built using Keras API.
